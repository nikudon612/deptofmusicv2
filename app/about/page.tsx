          Michael Freeman's prodigious talents playing reed instruments brought
          him from his childhood home of New Orleans to Berklee College of
          Music, where Michael's ska band was signed to Tim Armstrong's Hellcat
          Records. After successive Vans' Warped Tours, Michael realized that
          living in a van with ten other guys, playing the same nine songs
          repeatedly was not as glamorous as he'd envisioned. Subsequently,
          Michael quit the band and re-enrolled in college to earn his
          Bachelor's degree. But, Michael could never quit music, leading him to
          pursue a MM from NYU and ultimately an internship in the mcgarrybowen
          music department, which was led at that time by Rob Kaplan. Michael
          learned the craft of integrating music into advertising and excelled
          to the point where he, up until recently, ran Ogilvy's music
          department.

          Rob's journey from mcgarrybowen took him to Sony Music Publishing,
          where he represented the catalog to advertisers, brands and consumer
          products manufacturers globally, and then to form his own music
          supervision and production company, Wool & Tusk.
